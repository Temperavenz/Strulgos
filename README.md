Welcome to Strulgos!   
-   This entire folder aims to equip you the practical knowledge necessary for Data Structures & Algorithms.
NOTE: Only codes are available throughout this entire folder. If you want to know more about the theoretical concept of each data structure, I highly recommend visiting geeksforgeeks.

TIP:
*   Before starting your journey, make sure that you have a good understanding of pointers.
*   It's highly recommended that you study the theoretical concept of each data structure before trying to view how it's translated into code.


Navigation:

Special thanks to these people that made my DSA journey less painful:
- Ian de Jesus  (made me understand computer word)
- Bryan Sanchez (made me understand the practical concepts of dsa in general)
- Reece Lim (made me understand prim's algorithm)



DISCLAIMER: The code for Cursor-Based BST is unavailable.
            My approach for the algorithms isn't the most efficient. Though, it works.
