Welcome to Strulgos!   
-   This entire folder aims to equip you the practical knowledge necessary for Data Structures & Algorithms.
* NOTE: Only codes are available throughout this entire folder. If you want to know more about the theoretical concept of each data structure, I highly recommend visiting geeksforgeeks.


TIP:
*   Before starting your journey, make sure that you have a good understanding of pointers.
*   It's highly recommended that you study the theoretical concept of each data structure before trying to view how it's translated into code.


Navigation:
* Level 0 - ADT Array List, Linked-List, and Cursor-Based List
* Level 1 - Stack
* Level 2 - Queue
* Level 3 - Sets - UID, Bit-Vector, and Computer Word
* Level 4 - Dictionaries - Open and Closed
* Level 5 - Binary Search Tree (BST)
* Level 6 - Heap - Paritally Ordered Tree (POT), Heapsort
* Level 7 - Graphs - Implementations, Traversals, and Algorithms


Special thanks to these people that made my DSA journey less painful:
- Ian de Jesus  (made me understand computer word)
- Bryan Sanchez (made me understand the practical concepts of dsa in general)
- Reece Lim (made me understand prim's algorithm)



DISCLAIMER: 
* The code for Cursor-Based BST is unavailable.
* My approach for the algorithms isn't the most efficient. Though, it works.
